Assignment 5 README.

My p5 code defines a class called "Bubble" with constructor(), move()/update() and show() methods. The Bubble object has x, y, and r properties, which define its position and size. The move() method changes the position of the Bubble object by adding random values to its x and y properties. The update() method calls the move() method. The show() method displays the Bubble object on the canvas using an ellipse with a stroke, stroke weight, and no fill. I created an array called "bubbles" to create 5 Bubble objects with random positions and sizes. The draw() function sets a blue background and creates a tan rectangle at the bottom of the canvas. It then updates and displays all the Bubble objects in the bubbles array.

This sketch creates a program that displays 50 randomly positioned bubbles on a blue background with a tan rectangle at the bottom. The Bubble object has a constructor with x, y, and r properties, and move(), update(), and show() methods. The move() method changes the position of each bubble randomly, and the update() method calls the move() method. The show() method creates an ellipse with the x and y positions and r radius of each bubble. The program uses a for loop to update and show each bubble in the bubbles array, which is populated with 50 Bubble objects using random values for the x, y, and r properties.

This sketch defines three classes: Bubble, Fish, and Breeder. Each class has a constructor method that initializes the objects with various properties such as x, y, size, and color. The Fish and Breeder classes have display() methods that draw the object using p5's graphics functions. The Bubble class has a show() method that draws an ellipse. All three classes have move() and update() methods to control the objects' movement on the canvas. The Breeder class also has a checkCollision() method to detect collisions with other objects. In the setup function, I created arrays to hold multiple instances of each class and used for loops to initialize them with random properties.

This sketch creates an animated underwater scene with bubbles, stars, and fish. The code defines three classes: Bubble, YellowStar, and Fish, each with constructor(), move()/update() and show() methods. It then creates 50 bubbles, 10 YellowStars, and 50 Fish with random positions and scaled sizes, and adds them to their respective arrays. The code also defines a star function to draw the YellowStar. In the draw function, the code updates and displays the bubbles, stars, and fish by iterating through their respective arrays. The fish move horizontally across the canvas, changing direction when they reach the edges. The background has a blue color and a tan rectangle at the bottom.

This sketch creates a blue background with a tan rectangle at the bottom as the ocean. It also creates 50 randomly placed bubbles, 10 randomly placed YellowStars, and 10 randomly placed Fish of varying sizes and colors. Each object has move(), update(), and show() methods, which are used to update the position of each object and to display them on the screen. The Fish objects move back and forth across the canvas while the YellowStar objects move from one side to the other. The bubbles simply move randomly around the screen. The Fish objects are drawn as ellipses with a triangle for the tail and an ellipse for the eye. The YellowStar objects are drawn as five-pointed stars, and the bubbles are drawn as ellipses.
